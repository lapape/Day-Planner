# Day-Planner

## Description

The purpose of this site is to display a day planner that the user can store tasks to each hour of the workday. The blocks associated with each hour will chang color depending on the hour of the day. Past blocks are gray, present block is red, and future blocks are green. The user input for each time block can be saved using the buttons with the padlock icon. I learned about jquery and moment while building this site.
